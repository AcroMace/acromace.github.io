Pi Day is an experiment created in order to facilitate my learning of Python, using APIs, and creating a full screen desktop GUI. The project is currently in progress and will be switched to a public repository on Github when released.

Here is a basic outline of the current plan of how it will look when it is finished:

After I got a Raspberry Pi, I decided to learn Python as a way to tests its capabilities. I set Pi-Day as my goal to keep me motivated, and I used the online textbook [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) to figure out the basics of Python. I also followed the [API lessons on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/npr) as all the information I had to display were being pulled from online sources.

The current version fetches API keys and user information from a JSON file and fetches the following information and outputs it to the console:

- The internal IP address
- The external IP address
- Weather forecast for today, tomorrow, two days from now, three days from now
- Google Calendar events for the current day
- Gmail inbox
- Twitter feed
- Reddit front page stories


[The output has been posted on pastebin here](http://pastebin.com/ST4CFcfE)

<p>The current to-do list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on a more secure way to store user data</li>
<li>Use Tkinter to create a basic GUI to display the information</li>
</ul>
