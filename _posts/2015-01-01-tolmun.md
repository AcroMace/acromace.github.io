I was approached at the beginning of my last summer break of high school and asked if I was interested in making a website for a Model United Nations (MUN) project a few classmates were working on. Although I had basically no knowledge about MUNs, I agreed to join when they offered me a fancy title for the conference.

<blockquote>
<p>Township of Langley Model United Nations (TOLMUN) is a non-profit organization that promotes students across the Township of Langley to attend the TOLMUN Conference and engage in the world of Model UN to explore, learn, and discuss a variety of global issues at hand.</p>

</blockquote>

As the Undersecretary General of Information and Technology, I was told that my only job was to create a website. I had the freedom to do almost everything I wanted with one catch – *the budget was $0*.

I decided to go with the CMS that gave you the most control for the least amount of money – [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com/). Weebly lets you replace individual images and edit the CSS manually, which drastically increased the customizability of the website. It also automatically generates a mobile-friendly version of the website for you, which was highly important considering the demographic the website was targeting. [Here is the result](http://tolmun.weebly.com/).

When I started, I did not have access to the content that was supposed to be on the website (as it had not been created yet), so I focused on design and made liberal uses of Lorem Ipsum. First, I started browsing around various MUN websites to get a reference of the general topics that had to be covered and the functionality the website had to offer. Then I looked at various Langley websites to decide on a colour scheme and a font, found higher resolution images, and edited them to result in the following logo:

<img class="image-landscape-small" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/old_logo.png"/>

The first version of the website was almost entirely different shades of green and white with a few blue accents. I was and still am a big fan of minimalistic design, as you may notice from the current design of this website. No other secretariat was though, so quite a few aesthetic changes were made:

- The picture in the header was replaced with the current one
- The background in the body was changed from green to blue
- It turned out that announcements were not actually needed, so Twitter feed integration on the front page was removed

The additional changes to the design came after the content was introduced. Some of the features added before/during the conference that were later removed due to the lack of relevance were:

<ul>
<li>A Google Docs spreadsheet that detailed what delegate positions were available to take</li>
<li>A timer that counted down to the conference date</li>
<li>Staff and delegate application forms</li>
</ul>

The content on the site had to be surprisingly dynamic for a static website.

As the deadline approached, I was tasked with a few more things to do. One of which was making the delegate handbook. The following cover was created for the task:

<img class="image-portrait" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/old_cover.png"/>

Unfortunately, this was the point where the township contacted us and told us we were not allowed to use the city’s logo in our materials. As a result, the following logo was born:

<img class="image-landscape-small" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/new_logo.png"/>

Regrettably, the eagle was actually a picture of our school’s mascot, which had a very low resolution. The image of the eagle in its entirety was less than 200×200 pixels. If you zoom in enough, you can see that there’s a bit of a blur in order to decrease the rather jarring jaggedness in the outline.

To fit Weebly’s header, this variation was also created:

<img class="image-landscape-small" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/banner.png"/>

<p class="image-landscape-small-caption">It is slightly redundant, but there was nothing else to put in the middle.</p>

Of course, the theme of the entire delegate handbook had to be changed as well. It was created in Microsoft Word due to the sheer volume of content, so it was relatively easy to do. You can download the handbook by clicking the picture below (warning: 18 MB PDF):

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/embed/tolmun/Delegate Handbook.pdf">
<img class="image-portrait" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/tolmun_handbook_cover.png">
</a>

The custom designed images in the book were created in the industry standard 300dpi as it was meant to be printed. In contrast, you may see some extremely blurry texts in there, and that is because they are low resolution pictures of text. The end of the booklet has some pages that are considerably crowded as well, but I was unable to fix that due to the page number restrictions.

I was pretty happy with the result of the digital copy. Unfortunately, I later found out when it was printed that the inside of the handbook was actually greyscale. Also, The printing company could not print the PDF version as they could not open PDFs created on a Mac, so they printed straight from the Microsoft Word document, which apparently resulted in lower resolution images. I was slightly disappointed at the final result, but other people did not seem to mind as much as me.

Backgrounders were created with a similar theme, but were meant to be viewed online. You can view the PDFs online [here](http://tolmun.weebly.com/committeesbackgrounders.html) by clicking any of the topics under the sections “Topics and Backgrounders,” or download them individually here:

- <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/embed/tolmun/TOLMUN-HRC.pdf)">Human Rights Council</a>
- <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/embed/tolmun/TOLMUN-WTO.pdf">World Trade Organization</a>
- <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/embed/tolmun/TOLMUN-DISEC.pdf">Disarmament and International Security Committee</a>

The online versions show strange lines at the edges of tables. The most likely cause of this is that the PDF reader doesn’t recognize Quartz.

After that, I was tasked with creating name tags and placards for the students attending the conference. After looking at the examples of what was created for other conferences, I decided to keep it simple:

<img class="image-landscape-small" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/nametag.png"/>

<p class="image-landscape-small-caption">My name tag!</p>

The name tag would display the delegate’s name, country, and committee. Mine does not contain the country section because I was a secretariat.

The placards were much simpler than the name tags:

<img class="image-landscape-small" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/placard.png"/>

Some of the examples I saw were over designed to the point where the country’s name was illegible, so I decided to go exactly the opposite way to make the name the main focus. The whitespace on the top was deliberately added there as the placard was printed on a full sheet of paper and folded in half.

The next thing created was a banner for the Facebook group. I created a private Facebook group to test the banners a few times before uploading it to the collaboration group:

<img class="image-landscape" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/facebook.png"/>

Finally, I was asked to create an advertisement for the newspaper that was quoted in the top of this page. I took one of the advertisements on their front page, copied the resolution, and created this:

<img class="image-portrait" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/tolmun/newspaper.png"/>

Then I was done preparing for the conference!

For the actual conference itself, I was mostly there to make impromptu Powerpoint slides since, thankfully, everything worked out surprisingly fine on the technology side.

Overall, I really enjoyed working with such an [ambitious and effective team](http://tolmun.weebly.com/secretariat.html), and I also appreciated being exposed to a drastically new experience.
