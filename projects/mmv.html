                    <p>I discovered YouTube for the first time when I was in Grade 7. That’s where I found out about MMVs, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pkDOrQ3lB4">MapleStory Music Videos</a>, where people used character assets from MapleStory and made music videos with them. I decided I wanted to try making them as well.</p>

                    <p>I noticed that most popular videos used <a href="http://www.maplesimulator.com/programs/bannedstory">BannedStory</a> and Sony Vegas Pro and decided to learn how to use them myself. BannedStory lets you customize a character, pick a pose, then export the model as a .jpeg or a .png. Vegas Pro is a movie editing software, which I used primarily as a simple Movie Maker substitute in the beginning.</p>

                    <p>I edited each picture in Photoshop and created each section of the video frame by frame. I took the BPM of the song, used 30 fps as my standard, then calculated how long each image had to be shown in seconds. Then I exported it as a .gif file to use in Vegas Pro. Eventually, my first MMV was finished:</p>

                    <p>It’s not exactly impressive, especially with the plain black background, but I was fairly satisfied with my first attempt. However, I wanted to expand to something more ambitious before summer break ended and high school started.</p>

                    <p>This time, I decided to put in a background in Photoshop and extend the video until the end of the song. After 4 days, I came up with the following video:</p>

                    <iframe class="youtube-video" width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7pDVTSaD6qg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>The Viva la Vida video turned out to be my most popular MMV.</p>

                    <p>When I found out that I still had a lot of free time in high school, I continued to make videos. I wanted to make better use of Sony Vegas, so I tried to make better uses of transitions so they were more meaningful in the video. After two days, I uploaded the following:</p>

                    <iframe class="youtube-video" width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TKGcuhG_xto?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>Around this time, YouTube switched the player to a 16:9 aspect ratio. I tried to switch my videos to 720p, but the character sprites had such a low resolution (46 by 67 pixels) that it was too tiny on the screen. So I chose a resolution similar to what I had been working with, but made it wider to 560 by 315 pixels.</p>

                    <p>I also found out about Photoshop’s tweening feature and decided to use them to save some time. Unfortunately, the blurring effects used to make the transition smoother is somewhat nauseating when the FPS is low.</p>

                    <p>I never ended up finishing this video due to a lack of inspiration, but you can see the mostly finished result here:</p>

                    <iframe class="youtube-video" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/S8V9p6c7Q2M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>In retrospect, there is a shameless amount of logo showing in the video, and I apologize for my younger self in that regard.</p>

                    <p>I attempted another video to see if it was the song that I was getting bored of, and it was not. MMVs were simply going out of style while I was going through Grade 8, and I was getting sick of both watching or making them.</p>

                    <p>Thankfully, Grade 8 was also the year I was first introduced to programming, so I wasn’t ever given a chance to get bored of making stuff on the computer. Although it’s unlikely that I will ever make an MMV again, I will always remember how much I used to enjoy making these and how much effort I put into them.</p>
